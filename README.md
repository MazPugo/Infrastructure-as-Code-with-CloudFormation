This project introduces AWS CloudFormation, which lets you manage infrastructure as code by creating templates to define AWS resources. 
Instead of manually setting up services in the console, youâ€™ll learn how to automate deployments, reuse environments, and version-control infrastructure.

Hands-on tasks include:

- Generating a CloudFormation template

- Debugging common template errors

- Deploying resources automatically with the template

- Manually extending the template with new resources
